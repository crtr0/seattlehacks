Let's look at how the ideas of teaching children to program have shaped our industry to date and where there's still the most opportunity.  Reading the history of Alan Kay's Dynabook on a device remarkably similar (the iPad) I couldn't help but think, "We've been talking about this for 40 years... so how are we doing?"

We'll explore hardware, software, education and whatever else seems relevant.

<strong>Update:</strong> Caleb had a great idea, bring your kids if you want and we can try ideas, see what they've been doing, and explore some of these ideas with them.
