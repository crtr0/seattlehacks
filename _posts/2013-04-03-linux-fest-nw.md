LinuxFest Northwest is an annual event produced by the Bellingham Linux Users Group, and volunteers from other northwest U.S. open source users groups. It is held on the campus of Bellingham Technical College (directions at the BTC website under ABOUT BTC). The Fest features Linux and open source experts and aficionados sharing their experience and enthusiasm with a wide variety of free and open source technologies.

This generally means that there will be a lot of smart people who come with something to share and a desire to learn. This is a low cost/high value event that's held on a weekend, so there are also folks who don't usually go to commercial conferences. All in all, it's a lot of fun with fresh faces on eager people.

Since this is a free event and produced entirely by volunteers, we appreciate active participation from everyone when it comes to making the conference work. This can be as simple as picking up after yourself, fixing something if you see that it's broken, or jumping in to help. Please feel welcome to take an active role in making this a great event. The organizers help set the stage, but we all make the Fest happen!
