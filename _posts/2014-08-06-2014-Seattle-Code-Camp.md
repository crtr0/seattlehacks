From the Seattle Code Camp website:

"Code Camp is a community event where developers talk with-and learn from-fellow developers. All are welcome to attend and speak. Code Camps have been wildly successful, and we have been bringing that success to Seattle since 2005!

An original Code Camp organizer, Thom Robbins, wrote a six-point manifesto: Code Camps are (1) by and for the developer community; (2) always free (**see note below); (3) community developed material; (4) no fluff - only code; (5) owned by the community; and (6) never occur during working hours.

What can I expect at the Seattle Code Camp?
A full day of talking about code with fellow developers. Sessions will range from informal "chalk talks" to presentations. There will be a mix of presenters, some experienced folks, for some it may be their first opportunity to speak in public. We are expecting to see people from throughout the Pacific Northwest region and beyond.

The cost of attendance is $15.

**Why isn't it free anymore?

As organizers we really wrestled with the decision to charge a fee this year. We wanted to keep things inclusivse as possible and ensure everyone who wanted to attend could. With a free event a large number of people who sign up never attend. Last year we had ~40% of the registered attendees not show up. We have to commit to a certain number of catered lunches / snacks over a week in advance. This meant there was a lot of wasted food. Since the main variable cost we incur is catering and we have a limited amount of space to hold the event we decided to add a small fee of $15. The intent of this fee is twofold.

1. To cover our catering costs with the venue.
2. To have folks pause a moment or two to ensure they will really attend if they sign up.""
