The Feast Conference is an annual gathering in New York City. Over the course of two and a half days, we connect remarkable entrepreneurs, radicals, doers and thinkers who bring their skills to the table to make life better.

Hackathon participants will have full access to all The Feast 2013 events free of charge (standard ticket cost is $1,500). These events include the flagship Conference, The Feast Worldwide NYC dinner, and the official Feast After-Party. Not to mention the opportunity to present at the Conference itself - reaching hundreds of the future’s thought-leaders, innovators, and investors, as well as thousands of viewers worldwide.

We’ve worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Marina Martin, the CTO at VA’s Center of Innovation to spec out data needs for you to solve that could help 14.4 Million veterans across the country. They will be in attendance along with several veterans to offer context for the opportunities, and have offered to potentially continue development of relevant solutions that arise.
